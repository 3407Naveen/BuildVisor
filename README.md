# 🏗️ BuildVisor: AI-Powered What-If Construction Planner

> **BuildVisor is made for the Aurigo Infracode Hackathon 2025, an online event held from November 3rd to 7th, 2025, focusing on digital transformation in construction using AI, IoT, AR/VR, Blockchain, and GIS.
It was built under the “What-If Analysis with Explainable AI**

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**BuildVisor** is an **AI-powered What-If Construction Planner** built during a hackathon to help engineers, architects, and project managers **predict, simulate, and optimize** construction plans in real-time.  
It acts as a **smart digital assistant** that lets users test different project parameters — such as **budget, materials, labor, and time** — and instantly visualize how those changes affect **cost, delay, and risk**.

Unlike traditional tools, BuildVisor uses **Explainable AI (XAI)** to *not only predict outcomes but also explain them*, helping users understand **why** a specific plan performs better.

---

## 💡 Problem

Construction projects often face:
- Unexpected delays due to poor planning.
- Budget overruns caused by misestimations.
- Lack of visibility into how minor design changes impact overall project health.

There was **no accessible AI tool** that could provide predictive and transparent “what-if” analysis — until now.

---

## 🧠 Our Solution

We created **BuildVisor**, a web platform that allows users to:
- 🧮 Enter project parameters (cost, labor, materials).
- ⚙️ Simulate scenarios with real-time AI predictions.
- 🔍 Understand which factors cause risks or overruns using Explainable AI.
- 📊 Visualize outcomes using interactive dashboards.
- 📝 Export reports for planning and decision-making.

Built to run seamlessly on **Bolt CMS** with a clean, modern **UI/UX** for accessibility and intuitive use.
